# BitExchange
Compares the going rate for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, and Dashcoin in $USD from 3 different exchanges.

This was my first attempt at writing a NodeJS app. I realize that it is not written convetionally.
It was made for learning purposes and will hopefully eventually adhere to convention.

Before running, ensure that NodeJS is installed.
To Run:
  1.) Clone BitExchange to your local computer.
  2.) CD into the BitExchange directory and run "npm install"
  3.) Run "node bin/www"
  4.) Open a web browser and go to "localhost:3000"
  5.) If error, quit the server application in terminal and run "npm install request", restart server - this may solve it
